# MyPetSafe

MyPetSafe is a Node.js library designed to interface with PetSafe Smart Feed devices. This library is a direct transformation of the Python library [petsafe_smartfeed](https://github.com/Techzune/petsafe_smartfeed) into Node.js, maintaining its original functionality while making it accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers.
A special thank you to Techzune for their work on the original library.

## Features

- Interact with PetSafe Smart Feed devices programmatically.
- Built using modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices.
- Translated directly from the Python library for consistency across platforms.

## Getting started
See `app.ts` for an example of how to interact with the MyPetSafe api.
